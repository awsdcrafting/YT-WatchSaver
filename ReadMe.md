Features:

It creates a local webserver. <br>
The webserver listens on a port 15643 on default, or a port specified by you.

Planned:
- request to '/add' to add an url with a titel
- request to '/save' to save all logged to a csv file
- add sqlite db
- gui

Why does this project exists?

Mainly because I wanted to log the youtube videos that are played by the youtube mix / autoplay feature.
So that I can create a playlist with the songs later.
